🏰 Stronghold: Multiplayer Medieval Kingdom Simulator

Overview

Stronghold is a console-based multiplayer strategy simulation game developed using C++. The project simulates dynamic medieval kingdoms and incorporates diplomacy, war, trade, and internal resource management using advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts. It was built as part of the Object Oriented Programming Lab Final Project (Spring 2025) at FAST NUCES Faisalabad.

The game is divided into two modules:
- Module 1: Core Kingdom Engine
- Module 2: Multiplayer & Diplomacy Engine
